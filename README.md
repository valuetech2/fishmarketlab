About Dataset Here's a description of each column in the dataset:

Species: This column represents the species of the fish. It is a categorical variable that categorizes each fish into one of seven species. The species may include names like "Perch," "Bream," "Roach," "Pike," "Smelt," "Parkki," and "Whitefish."This column is the target variable for the polynomial regression analysis, where we aim to predict the fish's weight based on its other attributes.

Weight: This column represents the weight of the fish. It is a numerical variable that is typically measured in grams. The weight is the dependent variable we want to predict using polynomial regression.

Length1: This column represents the first measurement of the fish's length. It is a numerical variable, typically measured in centimetres.

Length2: This column represents the second measurement of the fish's length. It is another numerical variable, typically measured in centimetres.

Length3: This column represents the third measurement of the fish's length. Similar to the previous two columns, it is a numerical variable, usually measured in centimetres.

Height: This column represents the height of the fish. It is a numerical variable, typically measured in centimetres.

Width: This column represents the width of the fish. Like the other numerical variables, it is also typically measured in centimetres.
